Notes:		Made for the Unique Unit for a Belgian Civilization.  Basicly when the Normans tried to conquer the land to their north they were met with an unorganized rabble of peasants the just happened to route them.  A weapon called the Gutentag (which means 'good day') was partially responsible for this.  Basicly it's a large wooden club with metal spikes protruding in all directions.  Enjoy...

Credits:	Well credit obviously goes to Firaxis for the game, and Moenir for making Flicster.  And now Steph and his wonderful Storyboard Creator, without which I might never have gotten the time or energy to paste this together.
