^Although the bow and arrow was present among the Greeks for a long time, especially in Crete, dependence on it in the 
military was considered cowardice. Although it was used in some cases, such as in naval warfare where Greek triemes had 
4 archers among it's crew, the Greeks much rather used their spears. When it came time for ranged weaponry, they often 
preferred Peltasts and Javeliners to mere archers, indeed, javelins even found their way into the legendary olympic games.
However, as Greek city states and militaries grew in power, so did the role that archers played in warfare. In fact, in 
his famous campaigns, Alexander the Great had a number of mercenary bowmen from Crete among his ranks.
