Readme:
Create a new folder, Catapult Tetrareme in your art/units folder and unzip all the files to that folder. Then copy and paste the Catapult TetraremeLarge.pcx and Catapult TetraremeSmall.pcx into your art/civilopedia/icons/units folder. Then open up the Catapult Tetrareme32.pcx with an image editor, back-up your units_32.pcx and open it with an image editing program. Paste the image into a square at the end of the other icons, be sure to line it up correctly. Finally, backup your PediaIcons text and Civilopedia text. Then copy and paste the appropriate text below into its respective places (feel free to change the Civilopedia description, this is only my version). Finally, open up your scenario in the civ3-editor and add the unit (if you need help with this part, look around in the tutorials forum, I made this quick tutorial because some people organize their units differently).

Enjoy!

^ The Catapult Tetrareme is a powerful [Greek] seige galley. The instability added by the catapult, ship design and it being primarily oar-powered means it must end its turn in a $LINK<coastal=TERR_Coast> square or risk sinking in a $LINK<sea=TERR_Sea> or $LINK<ocean=TERR_Ocean> square.

^ A Tetrareme is an expansion of the Trireme, which has one man per oar and three vertical rows of these oars. The Tetrareme also has three rows of oars, but has two men for the top oars for extra speed, making the Tetrareme a Polyreme, that is any vessel that has more than one man for any row of its oars. Polyremes saw the most developement in Macedon when the successors of Alexander the Great were in power. Not only were bigger and bigger Polyremes built at the time, but catapults and other seige devices were being built into the hulls. This changed naval warfare, in that now a ship could disable or sink another ship without boarding or ramming it. However the growing size of Polyremes meant that smaller ships could easily out-maneuver them, eventually leading to their decline of use. Rome only briefly used Polyremes, and once they gained control of the Mediterranean there was little to no need for their construction.
