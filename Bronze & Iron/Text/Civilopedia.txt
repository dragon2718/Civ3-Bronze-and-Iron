;     Keys:
;       to add a game concept one must first add a Key for it.  these are of the form:
;			GCON_Name
;	    where Name contains only alpha-numerical symbols.
;		these Keys are used to look up the game concept Name and Text.
;       Keys are NOT translated.
;       Keys for other items (units, techs, etc.) are set by Civ3Edit.
;
;	  Game concepts follow the form:
;			#Key
;			Name
;			Text
;		Links in game concepts follow the form:
;           $LINK<Text=Key>
;		the Text -- everything between the '<' and the '=' must be translated.
;		the Key  -- everything between the '=' and the '>' must be a valid key
;					for the link to work
;
;	  Descriptions follow the form:
;			#Header
;			Text
;		the Header for descriptions must be in the form DESC_Key
;		so, for the game concept: "Territory" that has the key "GCON_Territory",
;		the Header should be "DESC_GCON_Territory"
;		A complete list of all Civilopedia Keys is coming soon.

#GCON_Barbarians
Barbarians
^
^
^[Barbarian tribes] inhabit every continent of the world and there are two types: Passive and Aggressive.
^
^
^{Passive Tribes} 
^Passive barbarians reside in small villages. When you send a unit into one of these villages, several
things can happen -- some good and some bad. Possible results range from learning a new Civilization Advance 
to enraging the residents and having to battle them.
^{Note:} Bronze & Iron Mod has no Passive Tribes on the premade maps.
^
^
^{Aggressive Tribes}
^These [named] tribes also reside in villages on the map, but they send out raiding parties
to fight your units and pillage your cities and towns. By destroying a tribal village you can stop the raids from
that village. But the survivors will move to a new site in explored or unexplored $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory>
and begin raiding from there.



#GCON_Outposts
Outposts
^
^
^The "Build Outpost" unit-action becomes available after the $LINK<Wood Working=TECH_Wood_Working> advance is researched.
^
^Outposts eliminate fog of war.  To construct an Outpost, move a worker to any land tile in neutral or owned 
territory and select the Build Outpost unit action.  Construction of the Outpost consumes the worker.  The range 
of vision for the Outpost is 1 tiles on flat terrain, 2 on hills and 3 on mountains.
^
^Outposts can only be used by the player who created them.  If an Outpost falls within the territory of any other civilization, it will be destroyed. Outposts can only be built in a tile that is empty, has a mine, irrigation, a road and/or an imperial road.



#GCON_Barricades
Barricades
^
^
^When a civilization has learned $LINK<standing military=TECH_Standing_Military>, its workers know how to construct stone and masonry [barricades], which are even more formidable than $LINK<Fortresses=GCON_Fortresses>. 
^
^A Barricades can only be built on a square already containing a Fortress. Even if unoccupied, barricades automatically stops movement of a ground unit entering its square (unless that unit belongs to the same civilization currently controlling the barricade's square, or if that unit has a $LINK<Right of Passage=GCON_Agreements> agreement through that land. Barricades become a fortress if their square is pillaged.
^
^Military units inside barricades have a few advantages.
^* They get a 100% defensive bonus if attacked (i.e., twice the defensive bonus being in a Fortress).
^* The $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> exerted by the fortress still applies to a barricades.



#GCON_Enslavement
Enslavement
^
^
^Enslavement allows a unit to potentially "enslave" a combatant (instead of killing it) when it wins a battle. A unit with the "enslave" capability has a 1/3 chance of enslaving a defeated unit everytime it wins a battle. As soon as the battle is over, the game determines if the defeated unit is enslaved; if so, the unit is turned into another unit type (as specificed in the editor) and is immediately under the control of the victorious player. 



#GCON_Plague
Plague
^
^
^The sudden appearance of The Plague can be a devastating event. Plague, if and when it occurs, can wipe out city population and land units (except Kings). The effect of plague is exacerbated in larger cities, walled cities and cities with $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce> and a $LINK<trade network=GCON_Trade>.



#GCON_ZOC
Zone of Control
^
^
^Some military units have a [zone of control] that influences the eight squares surrounding the unit. This represents the unit's ability to project its combat power into surrounding areas. Such units attack enemies that enter the zone of control without initiating a full battle. 
^
^In TAM, most units that have a bombardment value also have the ZOC ability.



#GCON_Unit_Support
Supporting Military Units
^
^
^Generally, each military unit must be supported with one or more gold per turn from its $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>. However, each form of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> defers these costs for a certain number of units, depending upon how many towns, cities, or metros the civilization controls.
^
^ See the individual $LINK<governments=GCON_Governments> for specific details.



#GCON_Governments
Governments
^
^
^There are many forms of government that you can use to control your civilization.
Each has advantages and disadvantages. The type of government you use determines:
^
^How efficient your $LINK<workers=PRTO_Worker> are (how quickly they get their jobs done).
^How much $LINK<Corruption and Waste=GCON_Corruption> affects your civilization.
^The number of citizens you can $LINK<draft=GCON_Draft> per turn.
^The number of military units that can be used as $LINK<military police=GCON_Moods>.
^The number of military units you can have before you must $LINK<support=GCON_Unit_Support>
them from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
^
^The possible government types are:
^* $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>
^* $LINK<City-States=GOVT_City_States>
^* $LINK<Confederation=GOVT_Confederation>
^* $LINK<Diarchy=GOVT_Diarchy>
^* $LINK<Early Republic=GOVT_Early_Republic>
^* $LINK<Deiokes Rule=GOVT_Deiokes_Rule>
^* $LINK<Imperialism=GOVT_Empire>
^* $LINK<Merchant Oligarchy=GOVT_Merchant_Oligarchy>
^* $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy>
^* $LINK<Oligarchy=GOVT_Oligarchy>
^* $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>
^* $LINK<Theocracy=GOVT_Theocracy>
^* $LINK<Tribalism=GOVT_tribalism>
^
^
^To change your form of government, you must have a $LINK<revolution=GCON_Revolution>.



#GCON_Mobilization
Mobilization
^
^
^When a civilization develops $LINK<Imperialism=TECH_Imperialism>, it can [Mobilize] its economy for war.
Mobilize your economy using the "Mobilization" button on the Domestic Advisor.
^
^
^{Effects of Mobilization}
^* During mobilization a city building a military unit produces one extra $LINK<shield=GCON_Shields>
in every square that is already producing at least one.
^A civilization that is mobilized:
^* May only build military units and military city improvements.
^* May not build peacetime improvements.
^* May not return to Normalcy until a Peace Treaty is signed



#GCON_Strengths
Civilization Strengths
^
^
^There are eight areas in which civilizations have natural [strengths.] Each strength gives a civilization one free Advance and one rules advantage as outlined below:
^
^
^{Agricultural}
^Agricultural city improvements are easier to build and the center city square produces one more food.
^
^
^{Commercial}
^The center city squares of all cities and metros produce extra $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and less $LINK<corruption=GCON_Corruption> is experienced.
^
^
^{Expansionist}
^The civilization starts the game with a $LINK<scout=PRTO_Scout> and can build more later, and passive minor $LINK<barbarians=GCON_Barbarians> are friendlier.
^
^
^{Industrious}
^Workers complete $LINK<tasks=GCON_Worker_Jobs> faster and the center city square of all cities produces extra $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields> in cities and metros.
^
^
^{Militaristic}
^It is easier to build military improvements and combat $LINK<experience=GCON_Experience> is gained more quickly.
^
^
^
^(continued)
#DESC_GCON_Strengths
^
^
^{Religious}
^Religious civilizations do not experience prolonged periods of $LINK<anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy> during $LINK<revolutions=GCON_Revolution>, and religious city improvements are easier to build.
^
^
^{Scientific}
^Scientific city improvements are easier to build and the civilization receives a free $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies> at the start of every era.
^
^
^{Seafaring}
^Each city built along the coast receives a commerce bonus in the center city square, and Seafaring city improvements are easier to build.  Ships move faster and are less likely to sink in the sea or ocean.



#GCON_Draft
Conscription
^
^
^When a civilization develops $LINK<Oligarchy=TECH_Oligarchy> its citizens can be drafted into military service. Each city can draft some of its population each turn, depending upon the government currently in effect.
^* A civilization in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy> or $LINK<Merchant Oligarchy=GOVT_Oligarchy> may not use the draft.
^* $LINK<City States=GOVT_City_States>, or $LINK<Diarchy=GOVT_Diarchy>, or $LINK<Early Republic=GOVT_Early_Republic> can draft [one] citizen per turn.
^* $LINK<Confederation=GOVT_Confederation>, or $LINK<Deiokes Rule=GOVT_Deiokes_Rule>, or $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy>, or $LINK<Oligarchy=GOVT_Oligarchy>, or $LINK<Tribalism=GOVT_tribalism>  can draft [two] citizens per turn.
^* $LINK<Imperialism=GOVT_Empire>, or $LINK<Theocracy=GOVT_Theocracy>, or $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic> can draft [three] citizens per turn.
^
^
^To utilize the draft, press the "Draft" button on the City Display.
^
^The draft produces the best $LINK<slave=GCON_Experience> unit that resources and technology will permit in that city.
^
^However, drafting citizens will cause unhappiness in the city.



#GCON_Maintenance
Maintenance
^
^
^Most city improvements must be maintained after they are built. This [maintenance] cost is paid from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury> once every turn.
^



#GCON_Combat
Combat
^
^
^[Ground/Naval combat] occurs when units of different civilizations try to occupy the same square. The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed. The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced).
^
^[Bombardment] occurs when a ranged unit attacks without entering the defender's square. Bombardment inflicts losses to the defender's health bar but never completely destroys them unless the attacker has the lethal bombardment ability.
^
^{Repairing Damage}
^A unit that takes damage in combat but survives can heal, adding one $LINK<block=GCON_Experience> per turn back to its health bar. To do so, it
^* must be in friendly or neutral territory.
^* must not move for a complete turn.
^
^{Repairing Faster}
^A city with a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> heals ground units completely in one turn.
^A city with a $LINK<port=BLDG_Port> heals sea units completely in one turn.
^A civilization with $LINK<Battlefield Medicine=BLDG_Battlefield_Medicine> heals in enemy territory.



#GCON_Transport
Transport
^
^
^Some naval units can carry or [transport] other units.
^
^Ships can be boarded from any shoreline by simply moving the rider onto the ship. They may also be boarded from inside a coastal city by right-clicking the unit in the garrison box and selecting from the menu, or using the Load command button when on the main map.



#GCON_Espionage
Espionage
^
^
^Once a civilization learns $LINK<Espionage=TECH_Espionage> and builds an $LINK<Foreign Ministry=BLDG_Foreign_Ministry>, it can conduct [espionage missions] to find out classified information about other civilizations, friend and foe. Espionage can also be used to harm a rival or sabotage his $LINK<production=GCON_Shields>. Remember though, failed missions can seriously damage your reputation.
^
^{Espionage Screen:}
^
^The Espionage screen is comprised of: current opponents, available missions, your current asset information, city selection,  and operational cost options. This screen is available for use once a player has discovered $LINK<Alphabet=TECH_Alphabet>.
^
^Your opponents are displayed followed by icons that indicate your Espionage status within that civilization. If the Embassy Icon  is displayed, you currently have an embassy within that civilization's capitol city. If the Spy icon is present, you have a spy planted within that civilization.
^
^The mission area displays the various diplomatic and clandestine espionage options which you may currently engage in. 
When an espionage mission button has been selected. The following is a list of espionage and diplomatic missions that may be performed:
^
^The assets section provides a summary of your current monetary and technological assets, including the amount of gold in your treasury, your technological achievements (those that apply to espionage), and your level of spy experience
^
^The operational cost options allow you to set the level of risk you are willing to undertake with regard to the current mission.  The controls for executing and canceling missions are also located in this area.
^
^
^(continued)
^



#GCON_Espionage_Missions
Espionage Missions
^
^
^{Launching a Diplomatic or Spy Mission:}
^
^You can launch certain diplomatic missions at any time after the discovery of $LINK<Alphabet=TECH_Alphabet>. Other  missions become available as your level of technology increases. Spy missions become available after you have discovered $LINK<Espionage=TECH_Espionage>.
^
^{1 -} Select the target civilization in the Opponents area.
^
^{2 -} Select a mission type (Diplomatic or Spy).
^
^{3 -} Select a mission.
^
^{4 -} Select the target city for the mission (if appropriate).
^
^{5 -} Select an option in the Operational Costs area.
^
^{6 -} Click Execute to launch the mission.
^
^Note that if you decide to NOT execute the mission, you can click Cancel or exit the Espionage screen to cancel it.
^
^The following is a list of diplomatic and espionage missions that may be performed (note that most missions become 
available after you have researched $LINK<Espionage=TECH_Espionage>):
^
^{Establish Embassy -} Attempts to establish an embassy with the currently selected Civilization.
^
^{Plant Spy -} This option attempts to plant a spy with the currently selected Civilization. 
^
^(continued)



#GCON_Spaceship
Silk Road
^
^To win the Silk Road $LINK<victory=GCON_Victory>, you have to be the first to complete the Silk Road to China.
^
^The Silk Road is comprised of these Caravan Houses:
^
^$LINK<Sardis=BLDG_SS_Thrusters>
^$LINK<Nineveh=BLDG_SS_Engine>
^$LINK<Babylon=BLDG_SS_Landing_Docking_Bay>
^$LINK<Rhages=BLDG_SS_Cockpit>
^$LINK<Marakanda=BLDG_SS_Fuel_Cells>
^$LINK<Tashkent=BLDG_SS_Life_Support_System>
^$LINK<Yining=BLDG_SS_Stasis_Chamber>
^$LINK<Anxi=BLDG_SS_Storage_Supply>
^$LINK<Lanzhou=BLDG_SS_Planetary_Party_Lounge>
^$LINK<Xian=BLDG_SS_Exterior_Casing>
^
^The Caravan Houses may be built in any order.



#GCON_Victory
Victory Conditions
^
^
^There are six basic ways to win:
^
^
^{Silk Road}
^One of the peaceful methods of victory in [Bronze & Iron Mod] is to be the first to complete the Silk Road to China. In order to achieve this victory, the player must be the first to complete the chain of 10 Caravan Houses that comprise the $LINK<Silk Road=GCON_Spaceship>.
^
^[Building the Caravan Houses]
^Each civilization can build the Silk Road, and construction of the individual Caravan Houses may commence as soon as the civilization completes the $LINK<Silk Road=BLDG_Silk_Road> (Small Wonder). All ten Caravan Houses must be completed before a caravan can be "launched".
^
^
^{Domination}
^Have 66% of the world's population {and} 66% of the world's land surface within your $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory>. This can be accomplished either by military measures or by $LINK<cultural=GCON_Culture> development (or, more likely, a combination of the two). 
^
^
^{Conquest}
^A purely military solution: conquer the world, civilization by civilization. If you eliminate [all] civilizations from the game, you win.
^
^
^{Cultural Victory}
^Make one of your cities or your whole civilization the envy of all man- and woman-kind. A city with a Cultural value of 20,000 or if your civilization is worth 100,000 and at least twice as much as any rival, you win.


#DESC_GCON_Victory
^{Diplomacy}
^After the $LINK<Siege of Carthago=BLDG_Siege_of_Constantinople> is built, there are periodic votes by the council to elect a Leader. To be elected, a candidate must win a majority of all votes. If you are the one, you win the game.
^
^[Candidates]
^There are always two, and sometimes three, candidates. To be a candidate in an election a civilization must, either:
^	* have built the Siege of Carthago.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's territory.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's population.
^
^If only one civilization is eligible, then the second candidate is the civilization with the largest population.
^
^{Histograph}
^[Bronze & Iron] runs until the year 600 CE. If the game ends and no one has finished the silk road, conquered or dominated the world, wowed the world with cultural achievements or diplomatic aplomb, then the winner is determined by constructing a [histograph.]
^
^A histograph looks at the total "Score" generated by all civilizations turn by turn over the course of the game. The civilization that generated the highest score -- on average -- wins. Being powerful in Ancient Times is just as valuable as being powerful in the Modern Era.



#GCON_Maps
Maps
^
^
^{Fog of Intelligence}
^The map is overlaid with a veil of darkness obscuring areas of the world your people have never explored. As units move over the surface of the world they reveal the unexplored areas, brightening the areas they can currently "see." Areas that have been explored, but are not currently "seen" by your people have a soft gray veil over them.
^
^So at any time, each and every square of the map is either
^* unexplored			in darkness
^* explored				in grayness
^* seen				well lit
^
^
^{World Maps} As civilizations explore the world and found new cities, they gather information and create a map of the world that is unique. For each civilization, it is comprised of the area its people currently see and the explored areas (as they were when last seen). This is called the civilization's [world map] and can be very valuable in negotiations with other, less knowledgeable, civilizations. You will be able to trade world maps after your civilization discovers $LINK<Map Making=TECH_Map_Making>.
^
^
^{Territory Maps} Each civilization also keeps a [territory map] showing areas under its cultural influence only. These are less valuable in negotiations, but still of some worth.



#GCON_Golden_Age
Golden Age
^
^
^Every civilization can experience a [Golden Age], a 25-turn period in which every citizen laborer in the empire is more productive, producing one extra $LINK<shield=GCON_Shields> and/or $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce> if already producing at least one. A civilization's Golden Age is triggered in one of two ways:
^
^{Special Unit Victory}
^Each civilization has one or more special military units. A civilization's Golden Age can begin when one of these military units is victorious in battle.
^
^{Great Wonders}
^Each $LINK<Great Wonder=MENU_Wonders> is associated with one or more civilization strengths. If a civilization builds a Great Wonder (or Wonders) that corresponds to [both] its unique $LINK<strengths=GCON_Strengths>, its Golden Age can be triggered.



#GCON_Age_of_Science
Age of Science
^
^
^Every civilization can experience an [Age of Science], a 20-turn period in which the 
$LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research> of each city in that civilization's empire is 25% more productive.
An Age of Science can only be triggered by a $LINK<scientific leader=GCON_Leaders>.
^
^{Note:} this feature does not work properly in Conquests as of version 1.22



#GCON_Disease
Disease
^
^
^[Disease] kills citizens and units that spend too much time in unhealthy areas like $LINK<floodplains=TERR_Flood_Plain>, $LINK<swamp=TERR_Swamp> and $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh>. Military units that fortify in these terrains are susceptible to [disease].
^
^Your workers can clear $LINK<swamp or marsh=TFRM_Clear_Jungle> and eliminate that risk.
^
^Floodplains are always risky.



#GCON_Territory
Territory
^
^
^Every civilization has [territory] (areas of the map claimed as national land). The extent of your territory
is the sum of all terrain squares under the cultural influence of your cities, which in turn is a
result of the $LINK<cultural value=GCON_Culture> of each city.
^
^
^{Borders}
^Your territory is defined by your [borders], which are drawn in your civilization's color, and clearly mark
your cultural boundaries. The area within your borders is [friendly] territory.
^
^
^{Advantages of Friendly Territory}
^Your territory has several characteristics beneficial to you.
^* Rival civilizations cannot benefit from the roads or imperial roads within your territory without a
$LINK<right of passage=GCON_Agreements> agreement.
^* You can always $LINK<"see"=GCON_Maps> squares in friendly territory.
^* Tradable $LINK<resources=GCON_ResourcesN> are easier to get when found within your territory
(no need for a $LINK<colony=GCON_Colony>).
^* You can eject rival military units from your territory during diplomatic negotiations.



#GCON_Trade
Trade and Trade routes
^
^
^{Domestic Trade}
^Domestic trade occurs automatically between cities of the same civilization that are [connected] to each other. Any tradable $LINK<resource=GCON_ResourcesN> within your territory that is connected to any city is shared by [all] connected cities. Every city that is connected to a resource has that resource in the appropriate box of the City Display.
^
^
^{Foreign Trade}
^A single resource icon is enough to supply the needs of an entire civilization. Excess resources may be traded to other civilizations if the capital cities of both civilizations are connected. You trade strategic and luxury resources with other civilizations during diplomatic negotiations.
^
^
^{Trade Route Connections}
Two cities are connected if any one of the following are true:
^* there is a $LINK<road=GCON_Worker_Jobs> or $LINK<imperial road=GCON_Worker_Jobs> running between them,
^* there are $LINK<harbors=BLDG_Harbor> in both cities and a visible water route between them.
^ In Bronze & Iron Mpd, the following improvements also act as part of the trade network:
^$LINK<Dock=BLDG_Dock>		(Phoenicia only).
^$LINK<Island Harbour=BLDG_Island_Harbour>	(Mycenaeans only).
^$LINK<Port=BLDG_Port>		(All civilizations).
^$LINK<Quay=BLDG_Quay>		(Minoans only).
^
^
^[Water Routes]: In order to use a water trade route, your civilization must be able to safely traverse every square of the route.
^
^The only exception involves enemy territory: two cities are not connected if the only road that connects them passes through enemy territory, or if a harbor is blockaded by enemy naval forces.



#GCON_ResourcesN
Natural Resources
^
^
^There are 29 [natural resources] represented by various icons scattered around the world. These fall into three
categories, [Bonus, Luxury,] and [Strategic].
^
^
^[$LINK<Bonus Resources=GCON_ResourcesB>] give city production bonuses in worked squares within a city radius. Bonus resources cannot be traded to other cities or civilizations.
^
^
^[$LINK<Luxury Resources=GCON_ResourcesL>] also give city production bonuses in squares worked by citizens. But they may also be traded along trade routes, and make content people happy in cities that receive them.
^
^
^[$LINK<Strategic Resources=GCON_ResourcesS>], like both the others, give bonuses to city production, but, like luxuries they can also be traded. Strategic resources are required for a city to build various military units and city improvements. Strategic resources appear on the map when a Civilization Advance exposes their usefulness.
^
^
^Luxury and Strategic Resources are referred to as {Tradable Resources.}



#GCON_ResourcesB
Bonus Resources
^
^
^[Bonus resources] are one of the types of $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN>. These cannot be traded like $LINK<luxury=GCON_ResourcesL> or $LINK<strategic resources=GCON_ResourcesS>, but do provide bonuses to worked squares within a $LINK<city radius=GCON_Radius>.
^
^
^{City Production Bonuses}
^A citizen laborer working a bonus resource square gains extra $LINK<food=GCON_Food>, $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields>, and/or $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>.

#GCON_Experience
Combat Experience
^
^
^Military units are rated according to combat experience: [slave, regulars, veterans,] and [heroic units].
The more experienced a unit, the more damage it can absorb before being destroyed in combat.
The number of blocks in the unit's health bar shows this distinction.
^
^{Unit Type		   Blocks}
^Slaves   				2
^Regulars				3
^Veterans				4
^Heroic units			6
^
^Some units have bonus health bar blocks beyond the default.
^
^Normally, cities produce regulars. But if a city has a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks>, it produces [veterans].
Sometimes you may institute the draft, which produces slave units.
^
^[Heroic units] cannot be built: they gain this status only through actual combat experience. A heroic unit can produce a
$LINK<great leader=GCON_Leaders>, if it continues to be successful.
^
^
^{Battlefield Promotions}
^When one of your units is victorious in battle, there is a chance it will gain combat experience and be promoted to
the next level.



#GCON_Leaders
Leaders
^
^
^There are two kinds of great leaders: Military and Scientific.
^
^A {Military leader} is born in combat. This [can] occur when a $LINK<heroic=GCON_Experience> unit wins a
battle. 
^
^A Military Leader can be used to either create an $LINK<army=PRTO_Army> or to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> production of an Improvement or Small Wonder in a city. When a military
leader does either of these actions he disappears.
^
^
^A {Scientific leader} comes about as a result of $LINK<research=GCON_Research>. Each time a technology
is researched for the [first] time by any civilization there is a chance that a Scientific leader will arise
(this chance is increased slightly if the researching civilization has the "scientific"
$LINK<strength=GCON_Strengths>.
^
^A Scientific Leader can be used to increase the scientific output of all cities of his civilization, thus
starting an $LINK<Age of Science=GCON_Age_of_Science>. Simply move the scientific leader to your capital and
press the "Increase Scientific Output" button. A Scientific leader can also be used to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> the construction of any [improvement] (including a Great Wonder) of the city
he's currently in. When the leader does either of these actions he disappears.
^
^(as of Conquests 1.22, Age of Science does not work properly)



#GCON_Armies
Armies
^
^
^An Army is actually a group of ordinary units that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit and then 'load' other units into it. You can load up to three units, though the $LINK<Mediterranean Warfare=BLDG_Caesar> increases this limit to four, if you have built it.
^
^
^{Building an Army}
^Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy> or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them. But you must have at least six cities for every army you create.
^
^
^{In Battle}
^An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle, depending upon the course of the fight.



#GCON_Hurry_Production
Hurry Production
^
^
^City construction projects (improvements or units) can be hurried to completion if necessary.  Use the "Hurry" button on the [City Display].
^
^
^Under some governments you hurry production in your cities by forced labor. Disillusioned by your harsh rule, citizens will leave your city if you institute this type of rushed production. 
^
^
^Under other governments you can pay overtime and hire temporary workers to complete a project. This costs gold from your treasury; the amount depends upon how much work remains to be done.
^
^
^$LINK<Great leaders=GCON_Leaders> can also be used to hurry production.
^
^
^You have [no] production if your civilization is in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>.



#GCON_Corruption
Corruption and Waste
^
^
^[Corruption] is income lost to theft, embezzlement, and other illegal practices. [Waste] is shield production
lost to inefficiency. If left unchecked, corruption and waste will significantly slow the development of your
civilization. You can track the status of corruption and waste in your empire on the
[City Display] and [Domestic Advisor].
^
^
^{Causes}
^In general, the farther a city is from its capital city, the more corruption and waste it experiences. Also the more cities in your empire, the higher rates of both, overall. Finally, the extent of corruption and waste is also affected by
the system of $LINK<government=MENU_Governments> you are currently using.
^
^
^{Solutions}
^A $LINK<courthouse=BLDG_Courthouse>, $LINK<city guard=BLDG_Police_Station>, or nearby $LINK<The Pantheon=BLDG_Pantheon>
reduces corruption.
^
^Another solution, is to change your system of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments>. The more liberal the
government, the less corruption and waste you experience.
^
^Being attached to your capital via road or harbor also reduces corruption and waste.
^
^We Love The ____ Day also reduces waste.



#GCON_Pollution
Pollution
^
^
^Pollution is caused by $LINK<volcanic eruptions=GCON_Volcanic_Eruptions> and large city populations.
^
^
^{Global Warming}
^If world pollution reaches sufficiently critical levels, there is a chance that global warming will occur. It can cause forests and swamps to disappear, and grasslands to become plains, and plains to become desert. World pollution is the sum of all city pollution.
^
^
^Polluted areas can be cleaned up by $LINK<workers=GCON_Worker_Jobs>, and pollution from cities can be lessened by
building $LINK<Sewers=BLDG_Sewers>.



#GCON_Embassies
Embassies
^
^
^When a civilization learns $LINK<Alphabet=TECH_Alphabet>, it can begin to build its intelligence network.
The first step is to build [embassies] in rival capital cities.
^
^Embassies cost gold from your treasury to build, and diplomatic missions cost gold to execute.
^
^Build an embassy by clicking the {E} icon next to the information window after you have learned Alphabet. This will open the Espionage Screen.

#GCON_Moods
Citizen moods
^
^
^Each citizen is either [happy, content], or [unhappy].
^
^{What Makes 'em Sad?}
^* $LINK<Overpopulation=GCON_Overpopulation>.
^* $LINK<Forced labor=GCON_Hurry_Production>.
^* $LINK<Conscription=GCON_Draft>.
^* $LINK<War weariness=GCON_War_Weariness>.
^
^{What Makes 'em Glad?}
^To combat unhappiness in your cities you can build improvements or take actions that produce
happy or content $LINK<faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>. Each happy face changes the mood of one citizen from content to happy; each
content face alters a citizen from unhappy to content.
^
^* Build a $LINK<Temple=BLDG_Temple>, $LINK<Amphitheater=BLDG_Colosseum>, or $LINK<Basilica=BLDG_Cathedral>.
^* Bring assorted $LINK<luxuries=GCON_ResourcesL> into the city.
^* Convert some citizens to $LINK<entertainers=GCON_Specialists>.
^* Increase funding for entertainment using the Entertainment slider on the Domestic Advisor.
^* Garrison military units in the city (Military Police).
^* Build any of the many Great and Small Wonders that reduce unhappiness
^
^A city in which more people are unhappy than happy falls into $LINK<civil disorder=GCON_Disorder>.
Content citizens and specialists are ignored.



#GCON_War_Weariness
War Weariness
^
^
^During times of war, citizens living under certain goverments become [war weary] and become $LINK<unhappy=GCON_Moods> as a result.
^
^When [you] initiate the conflict your people will tolerate it for a while, but then may become quite unhappy.
When someone else declares the war, especially a traditional enemy, your people are more forgiving.
Carrying on a defensive war, that is keeping your troops at home, is more tolerable than offensive campaigns.
^
^The only way to end [war weariness] is to stop the war. You can use all your normal tricks to
$LINK<make 'em happier=GCON_Moods>, but the war weariness remains until the war stops.
^
^Not all governments experience war weariness.



#GCON_Research
Scientific Research
^
^
^Your civilization is constantly striving to learn about the world, science, invention, and creativity.
Its ability to succeed at these pursuits depends in large measure upon your allocation of revenue to science.
You set the allocation on the [Domestic Advisor] by sliding the science slider left or right to decrease
or increase (respectively) the amount of your tax revenue that you divert into research. By doing this,
you determine the percentage of each city's income that will be poured into research.
^
^At the start of each turn, the science output of each city is added to the research project currently
in progress, eventually resulting in the discovery of a new $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies>.
^
^To increase the science production in only one city, you can convert a citizen or two to a $LINK<scientist=GCON_Specialists>.
^
^Finally, the science output of individual cities -- and the empire overall, in some cases --
can be dramatically increased by building science improvements and wonders in those cities.



#GCON_Food
Food
^
^
^[Every citizen must eat two food per turn or die.] Luckily, most citizens labor in
the areas around their city, yielding some combination of food, $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields>,
and $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and feeding themselves in the process.
^   In some cases, a citizen produces more food than he needs and the excess is put into
his city's food storage box each turn. When it is full, the storage is emptied and the city grows, adding
one citizen to its population.
^   In other cases, a city does not grow enough food to sustain its population, so food
is drawn out of the storage box to make up the shortfall. If a city cannot feed its
population either from new production or stored food, one of its citizens {starves} and disappears.
^   Food production fundamentally depends upon the terrain within the city radius, because citizens
laboring there produce food. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working			Produces this much food}
^Flood plains				3	4 if irrigated.
^Grasslands					2	3 if irrigated.
^Plains						1	2 if irrigated.
^Hills						1	2 if irrigated.
^Forests					1	cannot be irrigated.
^Coastal					0	cannot be irrigated.
^Sea						0	cannot be irrigated.
^Swamp					1	cannot be irrigated.
^Marsh						2	cannot be irrigated.
^Tundra					0	cannot be irrigated.
^Fresh Water Lake			1	cannot be irrigated.
^Note that some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus food as well.



#GCON_Shields
Production and Shields
^
^
^[Shields] represent [common] raw materials in the countryside [and] the labor
required to make useful materials from them. In essence they are a measure of [production].
^   The shields a city produces are used to complete its current project, which may be to build a military unit,
city improvement, or wonder. When the production box is full of shields, the project is finished,
the box is emptied, and a new project must be started.
^   Some cities lose shields to $LINK<waste=GCON_Corruption>.
^   Shield production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce shields. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working		Produces this many shields}
^Grasslands				0	1 if mined.
^Outcropping			1	2 if mined.
^Plains					1	2 if mined.
^Hills					1	2 if mined.
^Mountains				1	3 if mined.
^Tundra				0	1 if mined.
^Desert				1	2 if mined.
^Forest				2	cannot be mined.
^
^Note that some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus shields as well.



#GCON_Commerce
Commerce
^
^
^Commerce is the exchange of goods and cash between communities within and around a city, the exchange of
knowledge and ideas, travel and shopping. It is the commercial exploitation of goods and services within your society.
^
^Commerce production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce commerce. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working			Produces}
^Flood plains				1	2 with road.
^Grasslands					0	1 with road.
^Plains						0	1 with road.
^Hills						0	1 with road.
^Mountains					0	1 with road.
^Forests					0	1 with road.
^
^Note any square next to a river produces one extra commerce per turn, and
some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus commerce as well.
^
^
^The government derives {Tax Revenue} from commercial activity and divides the revenue into three areas,
^* The build-up of liquid wealth in the $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>,
^* Long-term investment in $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>, or
^* The entertainment of the population to produce $LINK<happy faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^The allocation of tax revenues into these three categories is set using the Revenue Slider on the [Domestic Advisor].



#GCON_Fortresses
Fortresses
^
^
^When a civilization has learned $LINK<masonry=TECH_Masonry>, its workers know how to construct
stone and masonry [fortresses]. Military units inside these bastions have a few advantages.
^* They get a 50% defensive bonus if attacked.
^* They have a $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> and fire at passing enemy units without receiving return fire.



#GCON_Short_Game_Modes
Short Game Modes
^{Regicide}
^Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has a "King" unit. This unit represents the civilization's Great Leader (for the Romans, the 'King' unit is Caesar). When the Regicide victory condition is enabled, if the "King" unit is killed, the controlling player is eliminated from the game. Once the "King" has been eliminated, all units, colonies, and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built on it. The Regicide victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Mass Regicide}
^Mass Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has several "King" units. These units represent the civilization's Great Leader (for the Romans, the "King" unit is Caesar). When the Mass Regicide victory condition is enabled, if all of a player's "King" units are killed, the controlling player is eliminated from the game. Once the "Kings" have been eliminated, all units, colonies, and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location. The Mass Regicide victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Elimination}
^Elimination is a victory condition. When this victory condition is enabled, any civilization that loses a city to an enemy is eliminated from the game. Once a player has been eliminated, all units, colonies, and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location.  The Elimination victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Wonder Victory}
^This is a new method of suddenly bringing a game to conclusion. If this condition is enabled the game ends as soon as [all] Great Wonders have been built. The winner is then determined based on victory points -- not necessarily on building the greatest number of wonders, nor a specific wonder.


#DESC_GCON_Short_Game_Modes
^
^{Capture the Princess}
^Capture the Princess is a method of scoring victory points. Each player starts with a "Princess" unit. This unit has no unit actions and can be captured. The "Princess" unit is immobile until it is captured, at which point it moves with its owning unit at its speed. The "Princess" unit starts in the players starting location. The goal for each player is to capture this unit and return it to their own capital, bestowing them with 1000 victory points. You may capture the "Princess" when any unit is in the tile with the "Princess" and executes the "Capture" unit action. Once captured, the "Princess" unit is spawned again at the original owner's Capital City. If there is no suitable city for the "Princess" to re-spawn in, it remains in the captor's Capital and bestows another 1,000 points upon that player.
^
^{Victory Location}
^Victory Location is a method of scoring victory points. Victory Location tiles are scattered about the map, represented on the map by a Victory Location icon. Players score points by capturing and holding Victory Location tiles. To score these points a unit with a defensive military stat must be in that tile at the end of all players' turns for that turn. Each turn a Victory Location is controlled, the controlling player gets 25 victory points. In single player mode, the starting location of each player is designated a Victory Location. Any terrain improvement, including cities, can be built on a Victory Location tile.
^
^{Reverse Capture the Flag}
^Reverse Capture the Flag is a new method of scoring victory points. This condition cannot be enabled for a random map game; it can only be used in a custom-made scenario. When in effect, one or more Victory Units (which [might] look like a "Holy Relic") will be present on the map. Like a "Princess" unit, a "Holy Relic" can only be transported by another unit. When the Victory Unit is delivered to a Victory Location (see above), the player scores a substantial amount of victory points.



#GCON_Ruins
Ruins
^

#GCON_Sacrifice
Sacrifice
^
^
^Sacrifice allows you to take an "enslaved" enemy unit and "sacrifice" it in one of your friendly cities. The steps to perform a sacrifice are as follows:
^
^
^(1) First, you must research the Tech Advance $LINK<mysticism=TECH_Mysticism>. Doing so enables all of your friendly cities to perform sacrifices. 
^
^(2) You must then attack and "enslave" an enemy unit with a unit of your own that has the "enslave" ability.
^
^(3) When you attack an enemy unit and win the battle, you have a 1/3 chance of that enemy unit being "enslaved" instead of merely dying. The enslaved unit retains its original identity. This enslaved worker unit can then be delivered to one of your cities for sacrifice. 
^
^(4) Move the enslaved enemy unit into a friendly city. Immediately, the "Sacrifice" button appears in the bottom center of the screen. Select this button to sacrifice the worker. You will be asked if you wish to proceed with the sacrifice. If so, select the proper response. The worker is immediately sacrificed to the gods and you receive a set number of Culture Points (as specified by another pop-up message). These Culture Points are added to your [total] Culture Points and for the total in that city. 



#GCON_Specialists
Specialists
^
^
^It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune a city's production. To do so, you'll want specialists.
Specialists do not work in the city radius so they don't contribute to city production of food, shields, or commerce.
Instead, they produce extra happy faces, scientific research, or tax revenue.
^
^
^{Entertainers}
^An entertainer produces one $LINK<happy face=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^{Scientists}
^A scientist produces extra $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>.
^(requires Mysticism)
^
^{Tax Collector}
^A tax collector produces extra $LINK<tax revenue=GCON_Commerce>.
^(requires Currency)
^
^
^To create one of these specialists, on the [City Display], click any square currently being worked;
the production icons disappear and an Entertainer appears among the population. If you wanted an entertainer, you're done.
If you wanted a different specialist, click on the entertainer to cycle through all the specialists.



#GCON_Tourist_Attraction
Tourist Attraction
^
^
^A Great Wonder can become a Tourist Attraction once it has "stood the test of time" for over a certain number of years. A Tourist
Attraction then begins to attract commerce to the city in which it is constructed, which steadily increases as time
passes and its fame spreads. The chart below indicates the amount of gold earned by the tourist attraction based upon the number of years that it has existed. 
^
^1000 (years) - 1500   +2 (gold)

^
^
^Hoplites were well-trained citizen-soldiers of ancient Greece. Armed with spears and durable armor, they fulfilled the heavy infantry role in most engagements.
^
^Hoplites will always be associated with the phalanx unit formation. This tactic involved tightly packed groupings of eight or 16 rows of soldiers, who, against other citizen-soldiers, move and attack in unison scattering less densely organized enemy forces. This tactic worked well, but broke down when facing more mobile and well-trained professional soldiers. The Roman legions victory over the Macedonian phalanx at Pydna in 168 BC effectively ended the Hoplite's battlefield usefulness.

^The [Ballista] replaces the Catapult as a flavour unit for the Etruscans, Oscan, Romans, Samnites, Umbrians.
#DESC_PRTO_Ballista
^
^
^The ballista (from Italian Balestra) is a powerful weapon conceived as a giant crossbow, to eject heavy darts singly or in groups.
^
^A ballista's arms are wood, each supported by being spun into the middle of a large rope. The ropes (one per arm) are the springs of the ballista. The ropes are made of human hair or animal sinew. When the bow-arms are pulled back, they twist the ropes. Winches pull the bowstring back.
^
^The Ballista was a very accurate weapon, but it had to compromise its accuracy for range. The bolts (arrows) were not nearly as heavy as a 200-300 pound stones. The lightweight bolts could not gain the high momentum of the stones used in onagers, trebuchets, or catapults. 
^
^The precise design of ballistae was a triumph of ancient engineering and mathematics. The surviving manuals provide exact measurements and calculations for building ballistae of any size.
^
^It was traditional in ancient Greek and Roman cities for women to grow long hair as a patriotic gesture in case the city suddenly required new ballistae.

^The first known appearance was in Siracusa, Italy, around 400 BC.

#DESC_PRTO_Greek_Fire
^
^
^Greek fire or Byzantine fire or liquid fire was a weapon used by the Byzantine Empire, said to have been invented by a Syrian Christian refugee named Callinicus of Heliopolis. It was capable of discharging a stream of burning fluid, and was very effective both on sea and land, but it was used primarily at sea. It is rumored that the key to Greek fire's effectiveness was that it would continue burning under almost any conditions, even under water. Enemy ships were often afraid to come too near the Byzantine fleet because once within range the fire gave the Byzantines a strong advantage. 
^The secret of manufacturing the fluid was very carefully guarded--so well that today we still do not know how it was made. Various sources speculate that its consituents may have included sulfur, quicklime, and liquid petroleum. 
^One other incendiary substance, perhaps that "secret ingredient," may have been magnesium, which will burn under water, and is a principle constituent in incendiary bombs of modern warfare. 
^These materials were apparently heated in a cauldron, and then pumped out through a siphon. 
^Byzantine fire was largely responsible for many Byzantine military victories, and partly the reason for the Empire surviving as long as it did, particularly near the end of the Empire when there were not enough inhabitants of Byzantium to effectively defend it. It was first used in 672 against an attacking Arab fleet, and it quickly become one of the most fearsome weapons of the medieval world; the mere sight of any sort of siphon, whether it was used for Greek fire or not, was often enough to defeat an enemy. However, it was hard to control, and often accidentally set Byzantine ships on fire as well.

#PRTO_Pirate_Galley

^
^[Pirate Galleys] are the scourge of the ancient Mediterranean and the standard barbarian ship.
#DESC_PRTO_Barbarian_Galley
^
^
^Piracy is a very ancient profession and was common at various times in the ancient world, even before the invention of gunpower. Several ancient nations actively suppressed the activity of pirates, such as the Etruscans and Carthaginians in the western Mediterranean and the Greeks, Macedonians and the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean. But the Roman Republic, who absorbed all these nations into her empire, were not interested in the sea, and so from the 2nd century BC piracy rose dramatically. Eventually even the Romans realised that something had to be done, and so in 67 BC they gave extraordinary powers to the proconsul Pompey who was given the whole Mediterranean instead of a single province as his command. Within two years he had cleared the pirates from their main bases of north Africa, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia in the west, and Illyria, Crete and Cilicia (in southern Anatolia) in the east, at last making the Mediterranean safe for Roman trading ships. Pirates did not reappear untill  250 AD, when the Goths began raiding the Black Sea and the Aegean. In the last days of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, piracy rode to new heights, with raiders from the Vandal kingdom of north Africa, the Visigothic kingdom of Spain, and even in the North Sea from the Saxons, Picts and celtic Irish. The Barbary Coast of north Africa remained a notorious haven for pirates well into the 16th century.

Earliest forms would commonly have been carved directly into a hillside. The ancient Greeks perfected the amphitheatre, constructing them of carefully hewn stone capable of seating several hundred spectators.

^
^The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the site of the original Olympic Games held to honor the king of the gods, depicted him as a massive ivory figure clad in robes and sandals of gold. The statue was almost four stories tall, with its head nearly touching the roof of the temple that housed it. The sculpture is described as exquisite in even the tiniest details by historians and writers of the day -- its robes intricately carved with designs of animals, flowers, and images of Zeus' children, and its base surrounded by sphinxes and other mythological creatures. Such a statue could not long escape the notice of greedy kings and warlords, and several attempts were made to steal the statue -- including one by the crazed Roman emperor Caligula.  The statue was finally successfully stolen about the third century A.D., and was destroyed in a fire in Constantinople just after the fall of Rome. No images or accurate reconstructions of this, one of the lost Wonders of the Ancient World, survive today.

^The benefits of using assassins and espionage in military matters were identified early in mankinds history. Both the pharaohs of Egypt and Caesars of Rome setup embassies in neighboring nations in order to monitor the expansion and movement of military forces. As technology increased the potential scale of warfare, it became critical to know from where and when threats would emerge. This can be seen in the plethora of methods used in acquiring information on a not-so-friendly nation. These include high altitude reconnaissance photography, actual battlefield observation, and covert missions. All this information usually focuses at the Intelligence Center, which collates and analyzes this valuable data from their diverse and remote sources.

#DESC_BLDG_Mausoleum
^
^
^The tomb of King Mausollos of Caria (from whose name the generic term "mausoleum" derives), a local Persian ruler, was not especially remarkable in its construction or size.  
Its status as one of the Ancient Wonders of the World comes from the dozens of painstakingly carved statues and sculptures that surrounded it. They depicted legendary and 
real people, and the noble animals of mythology and history.  Inside the mausoleum was a great frieze, or wall-carving, depicting an epic battle between the Greeks and the 
Amazons, and topping the mausoleum's dome was a huge statue of a four-horse chariot. The Mausoleum and its statues survived until after the Crusades, when Christian knights 
founded a new crusader kingdom in Asia Minor, and used the already-carved stones of the Mausoleum to build castles. The statues, in turn, spread around the world, until British 
archaeologists began to collect and recover them.  Some can be seen today in museums, but most have been lost or destroyed.

He... everywhere... and learnt of everything the sun of wisdom. He saw what was secret, discovered what was hidden, he brought back a tale of before the deluge. He came a far road, was weary, found peace, and set all his labours on a tablet of stone. He build the rampart of Uruk-the-Sheepfold, of holy Eanna, the sacred storehouse. See its wall like a strand of wool, view its parapet that none could copy! Take the stairway of a bygone era, draw near to Eanna, seat of Ishtar the goddess, that no later king could ever copy! Climb Uruk's wall and walk back and forth! Survey its foundations, examine the brickwork! Were its bricks not fixed in an oven? Did the Saven Sages not lay its foundations? A square mile is the city, a square mile date-grove, a square mile is clay-pit, half a square mile the temple of Ishtar: three square miles and a half is Uruk's expanse. See the tablet-box of cedar, release its clasp of bronze! Lift the lid of its secret, pick up the tablets of lapis lazuli and read out the travails of Gilgamesh, all that he went through. Surpassing all other kings, heroic in statue, brave scion of Uruk, wild bull on the rampage! Going at the fore he was the vanguard, going at the rear, one his comrades could trust! A mighty bank, protecting his warriors, a violent flood-wave, smashing a stone wall! Wild bull of Lugalbanda, Gilgamesh, the perfect in strength, sucking of the august Wild Cow, the goddess of Ninsun! Gilgamesh the tall, magnificient and terrible, who opened passes in the mountains, who dug wells on the slopes of the uplands, and crossed the ocean, the wild sea to the sunrise; who scoured the world ever searching for life, and reached through sheer force Uta-napishti the Distant; who restored the cult-centres destroyed by the Deluge, and set in place for the people rites of the cosmos.

#DESC_BLDG_Silk_Road
^
^
^The Silk Road was a network of trade routes between Asia and Europe connecting Chang-an, China with Antioch, Syria and other points. Silk first appeared in Rome in about 1 AD. It stopped serving as a shipping route for silk in around 1400. With extremely rare exceptions such as Marco Polo, no one travelled down the entire length of the silk road. Instead traders moved products in a bucket brigade fashion from China to the West. 
The haydays of the Silk Road correspond with that of the Byzantine Empire in its west end, Sasanid Period to Il Khanid Period in the Nile-Oxus section and Three Kingdoms to Yuan Dynasty in the Sinitic zone in its east end. Besides the continental Silk Road, historians also talk of a "Porcelain Route" or "Silk Route" across the Indian Ocean. 
^
^In its hayday, the Silk Road sustained an international culture that strung together groups as diverse as the Magyars, Armenians and the Chinese. Under its strong integrating dynamics on the one hand and the impacts of change it transmitted on the other, tribal societies previously living in isolation along the Silk Road or pastoralists who were of barbarian cultural development were drawn to the riches and opportunities of the civilizations connected by the Silk Road, taking on the trades of maurauders or mercenaries. Many barbarian tribes became skilled warriors able to conquer rich cities and fertile lands, and forge strong military empires.

^Some examples of iron ornamentation date back to 4000 BC, but the use of iron for tools, weapons, and other practical purposes did not 
become common until much later. Prior to this time, bronze was the most widely used metal for such purposes. Although the term "Iron Age" 
denotes a period of time starting around 1000 BC, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice at different times in different places. Iron is 
more common than copper and tin, the component metals of bronze, but iron is seldom found in a free state; it is most commonly found 
mixed with other minerals and elements. In order to be used, the iron must be separated from the ore. Once this technique was developed, 
and forges hot enough to melt the iron were developed, iron working became commonplace. Worked iron was harder, less brittle, and 
could hold a much sharper edge than bronze. Iron has remained an important metal throughout history, and is one of the major components
in the production of steel.

^A priest is a person who leads worshippers in performing religious ceremonies and rituals. The position was of extraordinary importance in early 
cultures, since men believed that their day-to-day survival depended upon the favor of the gods. The earliest priests were probably elderly men and 
women too infirm to hunt and gather, but revered for their holiness and wisdom. As the lines between the spiritual and physical were much less rigid 
than today, priests might also be the tribal healers or leaders.

Elephants in captivity are in most cases Asian elephants captured in the wild. Selective breeding of elephants is impractical due to their long reproductive cycle, so there are no domestic breeds. African bush elephants and African forest elephants are less amenable to training. 
The majority of elephants in zoos are taken from their homes and families in the wild. They are sometimes confined in small enclosures, with hard surfaces, where they stand for hours. As a result of this, elephants suffer from joint problems and foot diseases such as cracked nails, ulcers, fissures, arthritis and fractured toes.
Tame elephants have been recorded since the Indus Valley civilization around 2,000 BCE. With mahouts, they have been used as working animals in forestry, as war elephants (by commanders such as Hannibal), for cultural and ceremonial use (such as temple elephants), as a method of execution, for public displays such as circus elephants.

^Metal casting is the process by which a craftsman can make one or more metal objects by pouring molten metal into a mold. One of the oldest 
methods of making a mold is the "lost wax" procedure, which dates back at least to the third millennium BC. In this process, the craftsman 
creates a wax duplicate of the object around which is built the mold; the wax is then melted and flows out of the mold and is replaced by 
molten metal. Once the metal cools the mold is opened and the object is removed. Historically, sand and clay have been popular materials from which to construct molds.

^
^Domestication is the process of hereditary reorganization of wild animals and plants into domestic and cultivated forms according to the interests of people. In its strictest sense it refers to the initial stage of human mastery of wild animals and plants. The fundamental distinction of domesticated animals and plants from their wild ancestors is that they are created by human labour to meet specific requirements or whims and are adapted to the conditions of continuous care and solicitude people maintain for them.
^
^The principal aim of cattle breeding in ancient times was to obtain meat and skin and to produce work animals, which greatly contributed to the development of agriculture. Cattle, at the initial stages of domestication, produced a small amount of milk, sufficient only to rear their calves. The development of high milk yield in cows with their breeding especially for milk production is a later event in the history of domestication.

As stone tools improved forests could be cut to provide wood for burning, building and furniture, and when metal tools were developed this use and cutting of forests increased. In the Mesopotamia region, cedar from the Lebanon area was in high demand -- surviving texts from Egypt show large amounts of it being imported by ship for shipbuilding, furniture and for use in the Pharaoh's palace.

^The development of writing is considered one of the most important advances of civilization. The earliest forms of writing were simple symbols and marks, used to keep accounts and inventories. Some cultures developed pictographic symbols to tell stories and record events. Eventually, complete systems of writing were developed, capable of conveying any thought that could be expressed orally. At this point, scribes replaced the oral historian as the chief keepers of records. Writing allowed the presentation of information in a form that could be reliably transmitted from person to person and made it possible for ideas, history, and knowledge to be stored permanently and passed between cultures more reliably than through oral recitation.

Spearmen and archers fighting "mounted" inside the chariot provided a superior fighting force.

#DESC_TECH_Greek_Fire

^Liquid Fire was a weapon used by the Byzantine Empire, said to have been invented by a Syrian Christian refugee named Callinicus of Heliopolis. It was capable of discharging a stream of burning fluid, and was very effective both on sea and land, but it was used primarily at sea. It is rumored that the key to Greek fire's effectiveness was that it would continue burning under almost any conditions, even under water. Enemy ships were often afraid to come too near the Byzantine fleet because once within range the fire gave the Byzantines a strong advantage.
^ 
^The secret of manufacturing the fluid was very carefully guarded--so well that today we still do not know how it was made. Various sources speculate that its consituents may have included sulfur, quicklime, and liquid petroleum. One other incendiary substance, perhaps that "secret ingredient," may have been magnesium, which will burn under water, and is a principle constituent in incendiary bombs of modern warfare. These materials were apparently heated in a cauldron, and then pumped out through a siphon.
^ 
^Byzantine fire was largely responsible for many Byzantine military victories, and partly the reason for the Empire surviving as long as it did, particularly near the end of the Empire when there were not enough inhabitants of Byzantium to effectively defend it. It was first used in 672 against an attacking Arab fleet, and it quickly become one of the most fearsome weapons of the medieval world; the mere sight of any sort of siphon, whether it was used for Greek fire or not, was often enough to defeat an enemy. However, it was hard to control, and often accidentally set Byzantine ships on fire as well.

and freshwater clams - those whose shells are lined with "mother of pearl" (or nacre) - produce the most sought-after 
varieties. The color of the pearl varies depending upon the mollusk and the local environment. Colors range from black 
to white, with cream, blue, yellow and green also occurring. The rose-colored Indian pearls are generally the most 
valued.

In ancient Greece and Rome, olive oil was an important commodity; special ships were built just for transporting it from Greece and Italy to trading posts around the Mediterranean. There was a widespread belief at the time that olive oil prolonged youth and life in general. Even today, the value of extra-virgin olive oil is recognized as it helps the body to assimilate vitamins A, D and K.

#DESC_GOVT_City_States
^
^
^City State is a ruling system where the citizens have a great deal of control over the actions of the government, either directly or through elected representatives.  Citizens gather in a public forum, and each one would have the opportunity to speak and vote on issues affecting the community. The Greeks were the ones that first used it in the Mediterranean, but the Ancient Samarians were the very first to practice it. This direct democracy system was possible due to the relatively small populations of the city-states. City-States were the most creative and scientific, but they didnt have the military power to hold an empire since that one city was the only thing the government would care about.

^Imperialism is a $LINK<xenophobic=GCON_Xenophobic> a type of nation rather than a form of government, but it does have different actions and priorities than the Government it is based on. The greatest empire of all was the Roman Empire.  But before it was an Empire it was under the form of government Republic.  Most of the time you will find an Empire under a Monarchy form, like the Babylonian Empire and Persian Empire.  An Empire is formed when it has conquered territories surrounding them.  Notice that Empires are not very efficient for small territories.  When in Empire Government, governors are more powerful then before.  Empires are great at supporting a large army.

^^Diarchy is one of the oldest forms of government: examples include ancient Sparta, Rome, Carthage as well Germanic and Dacian tribes. Several ancient Polynesian societies also exhibited a diarchic political structure. Ranks in the Inca Empire were structured in moieties, with two occupants of each rank, but with different prestige, one hanan (upper) and one hurin (lower). In modern usage, diarchy means a system of dual rule, whether this be of a government or of an organization. Such 'diarchies' are not hereditary..

^Leaders controlled their people as a Minister or priest.  Theocracy is centered on religion.  The people believe in God as ruler and a middleman to order what God wants.  The power over the people of a Duke or Priest is very focused on citizen moods. It is law for a citizen to be happy.  Also corruption is low because of the strict order.  Everyone believes and thinks that everything that the government does is right.  It was good because people were happy and war could be easily entered.  Although the strict order had disadvantages, new believes were always put down and never considered.  The people that did try this were fined for telling the truth of a discovery (Galileo Galilei).  Earlier European powers took over this governmental power but eventually fell in the renaissance (Roman Catholic Church).  Slaves were very common in ancient Theocracies like Egypt and the Arab Kingdoms.  This was because Religions did not consider other people much.  Mostly there were lots of guards for the leaders or priests ^for Theocracy.  It was for respect on giving priest protection as if these peoples were gate to God.  This government was very good for some people (Arabs) and sometimes not so good (Europe).

elected from the influential families such as the Barca family of Hannibal).

Romes government changed around 500BC from a kingdom into a republic. The "Res Publica" is a system of government in which the citizens appoint, by popular 
vote, a head of state and officials to represent the views of the general public. The concept of the republic first appeared in ancient Rome, where local 
provinces sent elected representatives to the Senate, which governed all Roman lands. Both the head of state and the local representatives in a republic 
are elected; no one is granted a position by birth or divine right. The highest power was in the hands of the Senate and the two Consuls, elected for one year.
^During the times of  the early republic many conflicts took place between the noble Patricians and the poorer Plebejans, which were the majority of Romes citizens.
Step by step until 287BC, the Plebejans reached  more political rights and access to all the important administration positions. Finally, the new Roman Nobility developed, 
consisting of a mixture of Partricians and Plebejans. Compared to the Greek $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy>, the Roman Republic allows a stronger military, the instauration 
of Martial Law and a more aggresive attitude but a higher corruption occurs.

^Argos was a major stronghold ofMycenaeantimes, and along with the neighbouring acropolis ofMycenaeandTirynsbecame a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis. Argos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler KingPheidon. Under Pheidon Argos regained sway over the cities of theArgolidand challengedSpartas dominance of the Peloponnese. During this time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery shops, tanneries and clothes artisanships. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. 
^Argos during prehistoric time, is by many considered to be the first town ever. The first settlement of modern-day Argos took place in late 3rd millennium BC, duringneolithictimes. Since then, it's been continually inhabited and rebuilt in the same area, whereas it was first colonized inprehistoric timesby thePelasgian Greeks. During theDorian invasion, circa 1098 BC, Argos was divided into four neighbourhoods, each of them inhabited by a differentphyle.

They were called the Dananiyim.Some scholars argue for a connection with the Greek Danaoi alternate names for the Achaeans familiar from Homer. Greek myth refers to Danaos who with his daughters came from Egypt and settled in Argos. Through Dana's son, Perseus, the Danaans are said to have built Mycenae.There are suggestions that the Denyen joined with Hebrews to form one of the original 12 tribes of Israel. No strong evidence support this view, however.

^Cycladic civilization (also known as Cycladic culture or The Cycladic period) is an Early Bronze Age culture of the Cyclades, Greece, in the Aegean Sea, spanning the period from approximately 32002000 BC.
^The significantLate Neolithicand Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic flat female idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age ("Minoan") culture arose inCrete, to the south. 
^A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BC, based onemmer wheatand wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats. Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities. When the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception ofDelos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary through the period of Classical Greek civilization.

^Eteocretans are often recorded in the Greek sources as an ancient Cretan population. Homer mentions them along with Achaeans, Dorians, Kydones and Pelasgians, whereas Diodorus Siculus reports a tradition according to which they were the oldest autochthonous population of the island.
^The name Eteocretans literally means The true Cretans and, as such, could have designated the ethnic groups which were present on the island before the arrival of the Greeks (the Mycenaeans, around 1450 BC, or the Dorians, probably after 1200 BC).
^The first hypothesis is partly supported by the fact that no East Cretan toponym is ever recorded in the Knossos Linear B tablets, and that, according to the Greek sources, the Eteocretans lived in Eastern Crete. Accordingly, it is possible that the local populations offered resistance to the Mycenaean penetration to the East during the 15th-13th centuries BC.

The territory the Illyrians inhabited came to be known as Illyria to Greek and Roman authors.The name "Illyrians", as applied by the ancient Greeks to their northern neighbors, may have referred to a broad, ill-defined group of peoples, and it is today unclear to what extent they were linguistically and culturally homogeneous.
^In fact, an Illyric origin was and still is attributed also to a few ancient peoples in Italy, in particular the Iapyges, Dauni and Messapi, as it is thought that, most likely, they had followed Adriatic shorelines to the peninsula, coming from the geographic "Illyria".

Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants and covering 6.5 million square kilometers during its height between the first and second centuries AD.In its approximately 12 centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic empire. Through conquest and assimilation, it came to dominate Southern and Western Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa, and parts of Northern and Eastern Europe.

Their lands were called Libya, and extended from modern Morocco to the western borders of Ancient Egypt.
^There were many Berber tribes in ancient Libya, including the now extinct Psylli, with the Libu being the most prominent. The ancient Libyans were nomad hunter gatherers, living off their goats, camels and other livestock while hunting and gathering at the same time. Milk, meat, hides and wool were gathered from their livestock for food, tents and clothing.
^Ancient Egyptian sources describe Libyan men with long hair, braided and beaded, neatly parted from different sides and decorated with feathers attached to leather bands around the crown of the head while wearing thin robes of antelope hide, dyed and printed, crossing the shoulder and coming down until mid calf length to make a robe. Older men kept long braided beards. Women wore the same robes as men, plaited, decorated hair and both genders wore heavy jewellery. Weapons included bows and arrows, hatchets, spears and daggers.

^The Nuragic civilization was a civilization of Sardinia, lasting from the Bronze Age to the 2nd century AD. The name derives from its most characteristic monuments, the nuraghes. They consist of tower-fortresses, built starting from about 1800 BC. Today some 7,000 nuraghes dot the Sardinian landscape. No written record of this civilization seems to have come down to us. The only information, more mythological than historical, that we have, come from the much later Greek-Roman classic literature.The late Bronze Age saw a vast migration of the so-called sea people, described in ancient Egyptian sources.
^They destroyed Mycenaean and Hittite sites and also attacked Egypt. According to Giovanni Ugas the Sherden, one of the most important tribes of the sea peoples, are to be identified with the Nuragic Sardinians. Another hypothesis is that they arrived to the island around the 13th or 12th century after the failed invasion of Egypt. However, these theories remain controversial. Plutarch spoke of raids by Sardinians against the island of Crete, in the same period in which the Sea People invaded Egypt. This would at least confirm that Nuragic Sardinians frequented the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

^The Umbri were an Italic tribe of ancient Italy. A region called Umbria still exists and is now occupied by Italian speakers. It is somewhat smaller than the ancient Umbria. Most ancient Umbrian cities were settled in the 9th-4th centuries BC on easily defensible hilltops. Umbria was bordered by the Tiber and Nar rivers and included the Apennine slopes on the Adriatic. The ancient Umbrian language is a branch of a group called Oscan-Umbrian, which is related to the Latino-Faliscan languages.
^Also called Ombrii in some Roman sources. Many Roman writers thought the Umbri to be Celtic; Cornelius Bocchus wrote that they descended from an ancient Gaulish tribe. Plutarch wrote that the name might be a different way of writing the name of the Celtic tribe Ambrones, which loosely means "King of the Boii." He also suggested that the Insubres, another Gaulish tribe, might be connected; their Celtic name Isombres could possibly mean "Lower Umbrians," or inhabitants of the country below Umbria.

^The Osci were an Italic people of Campania and Latium adiectum during Roman times. They spoke the Oscan language, also spoken by the Samnites of Southern Italy. Although the language of the Samnites was called Oscan, the Samnites were never called Osci, or the Osci Samnites.Traditions of the Opici fall into the legendary period of Italian history, approximately the first half of the first millennium BC, down to the foundation of the Roman Republic. No agreement can be reached concerning their location and language. At the end of that time, the Oscan language appeared and was spoken by a number of sovereign tribal states. By far the most important in military prowess and wealth was the Samnites. Between the Samnites and the Romans were the Oscans. Though often eager to go to war, they were never a power to be taken seriously militarily. They cost the Romans no more than a single battle to defeat on every trial of their prowess.
^Their final disposition more closely resembled the farces with which they regaled Roman audiences than a serious war. They kept their independence by playing off one state against another, especially the Romans and Samnites. That sovereignty fell victim at last to the Second Samnite War, when prior to invading Samnium, the Romans found it necessary to secure the border tribes. After the war, they assimilated quickly to Roman culture. Their memory survived only in place names and in literature.

^The Frentani are expressly termed by Strabo as a Samnite people, and he appears to distinguish them as such from the neighbouring tribes of the Marrucini, Peligni, and Vestini, with whom they had otherwise much in common. They, however, appear in history as a separate people, having their own national organisation; and though they may at one have constituted one of the four nations of the Samnite confederacy, this seems to have been no longer the case when that power came into collision with Rome. Their conduct during the long struggle between the Samnites and Romans renders this almost certain. 
^In 319 BCE, indeed, when their name occurs for the first time in history, they appear in arms against Rome, but were quickly defeated and reduced to submission and a few years afterwards (304 BCE), at the close of the Second Samnite War, the Frentani are mentioned, together with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Peligni, as coming forward voluntarily to sue for a treaty of alliance with Rome, which they seem to have subsequently adhered to with steadfastness.

Livy speaks in more than one passage of the Caudini as a tribe or people, in the same terms as of the Hirpini, and Niebuhr supposed them to have been one of the four tribes comprising the Samnite confederacy.

^The Hirpini were an ancient Samnite people of Southern Italy. While general regarded as having been Samnites, sometimes they are treated as a distinct and independent nation. They inhabited the southern portion of Samnium, in the more extensive sense of that name, roughly the area now known as Irpinia from their name, a mountainous region bordering on Basilicata towards the south, on Apulia to the east, and on Campania towards the west. In the Second Punic War, the Hirpini appear as an independent people, acting apart from the rest of the Samnites. Livy expressly uses the name of Samnium in contradistinction to the land of the Hirpini.
^The latter people was one of those that declared in favour of Hannibal immediately after the battle of Cannae, 216 BCE; but the Roman colony of Beneventum never fell into the hands of the Carthaginian general. In 214 BCE, their territory was the scene of the operations of Hanno against Tiberius Gracchus, and again in 212 BCE of those of the same Carthaginian general with a view to the relief of Capua. It was not until 209 BCE, when Hannibal lost all footing in the center of Italy, that the Hirpini submitted to Rome, and gained favourable terms by betraying the Carthaginian garrisons in their towns.

They were diverse in way of life and social organization, varying from the populous trade center of the city of Corinth, known for its ornate style in art and architecture, to the isolationist, military state of Sparta. And yet, all Hellenes knew which localities were Dorian, and which were not. Dorian states at war could more likely, but not always, count on the assistance of other Dorian states.

^The Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes inhabiting a large area in Southeastern Europe. 
^The origins of the Thracians remain obscure, in the absence of written historical records. Evidence of proto-Thracians in the prehistoric period depends on artifacts of material culture. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age when the latter, around 1500 BC, mixed with indigenous peoples. We speak of proto-Thracians from which during the Iron Age (about 1000 BC) Dacians and Thracians begin developing.
^Divided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the fifth century BC. A strong Dacian state appeared in the first century BC, during the reign of King Burebista. Including the Illyrians, the mountainous regions were home to various peoples regarded as warlike and ferocious Thracian tribes, while the plains peoples were apparently regarded as more peaceable.

^Arzawa in the second half of the 2nd millennium was the name of a region and a political entity (a "kingdom" or a federation of local powers) in Western Anatolia. The core of Arzawa is believed to have been located along the Kestros River with its capital at Apasa, later known as Ephesus. When the Hittites conquered Arzawa it was divided into three Hittite provinces: a southern province called Mira along the Maeander River, which would later become known as Caria; a northern province called the Seha River Land, along the Gediz River, which would later become known as Lydia; and an eastern province called Hapalla. 
^It was the successor state of the Assuwa league, which also included parts of western Anatolia, but was conquered by the Hittites in c. 1400.Arzawa was the western neighbour and rival of the Middle and New Hittite Kingdoms. On the other hand it was in close contact with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite texts, which corresponds to the Achaeans of Mycenaean Greece. Moreover, Achaeans and Arzawa formed a coalition against the Hittites, in various periods.

^The Hittites were an Ancient Anatolian people who established an empire centered on Hattusa in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I, when it encompassed an area that included most of Asia Minor as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. After c. 1180 BC, the empire came to an end during the Bronze Age collapse, splintering into several independent "Neo-Hittite" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC.
^The Hittite language was a distinct member of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. They referred to their native land as Hatti. 
^The Hittite military made successful use of chariots. Although belonging to the Bronze Age, they were the forerunners of the Iron Age, developing the manufacture of iron artefacts from as early as the 18th century BC; at this time, gifts from the "man of Burushanda" of an iron throne and an iron sceptre to the Kaneshite king Anitta were recorded in the Anitta text inscription.

^Kizzuwatna is the name of an ancient Anatolian kingdom in the 2nd millennium BC. It was situated in the highlands of southeastern Anatolia, near the Gulf of Iskenderun in modern-day Turkey. The center of the kingdom was the city of Kummanni, situated in the highlands. In a later era, the same region was known as Cilicia.
^Several ethnic groups coexisted in the Kingdom of Kizzuwatna. The Hurrians inhabited this area at least since the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The Hittite expansion in the early Old Kingdom period (under Hattusili I and Mursili I) was likely to bring the Hittites and the Luwians to southeastern Anatolia. The Luwian language was part of the Indo-European language group, with close ties to the Hittite language. Both the local Hittites and the Luwians were likely to contribute to the formation of independent Kizzuwatna after the weakening of the Hittite Old Kingdom. 
^Puduhepa, queen of the Hittite king Hattusili III, came from Kizzuwatna, where she had been a priestess. Their pantheon was also integrated into the Hittite one, and the goddess Hebat of Kizzuwatna became very important in Hittite religion towards the end of the 13th century BC.

^Mitanni also called Hanigalbat in Assyrian or Naharin in Egyptian texts was a Hurrian-speaking state in northern Syria and southeast Anatolia from ca. 1500 BC1300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class governing a predominantly Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Amorite Babylon and a series of ineffectual Assyrian kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination.
^At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, Mitanni had outposts centered on its capital, Washukanni, whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to the status of a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

^Babylon was a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, in the fertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city was built upon the Euphrates and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Semitic Akkadian city dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC.
^The town attained independence as part of a small city state with the rise of the First Amorite Babylonian Dynasty in 1894 BC. Claiming to be the successor of the more ancient Sumero-Akkadiancity of Eridu, Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the "holy city" of Mesopotamia around the time Amorite king Hammurabi created the first short lived Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC. Babylon grew and South Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia.
^The empire quickly dissolved after Hammurabi's death and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian, Kassite and Elamite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 609 to 539 BC. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 
^It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from c. 1770 to 1670 BC, and again between c. 612 and 320 BC. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.

^Assyria, a major Mesopotamian East Semitic kingdom and empire of the Ancient Near East, existed as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries, from the 25th century BCE to the 6th century BCE, spanning the mid to Early Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. For a further thirteen centuries, from the beginning of the 6th century BCE to the mid-7th century AD, it survived as a geo-political entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of small Neo-Assyrian states such as Assur, Adiabene,Osroene and Hatra arose at different times between the 1st century BC and late 3rd century CE.
^Centered on the Upper Tigris river, in northern Mesopotamia (modern northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and the northwestern fringes of Iran), the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian "cradle of civilization," which included Sumer, Akkad and much later Babylonia, Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea to Persia, and from what is now Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, to the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and eastern Libya.

^The Hyksos "ruler(s) of the foreign countries"; were a mixed group of Asiatic people from Western Asia who took over the eastern Nile Delta, ending the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt and initiating the Second Intermediate Period. 
^There are various hypotheses as to the Hyksos' ethnic identity. Most archaeologists describe the Hyksos as multi-ethnic, to include all of the peoples who occupied the Nile Delta.
^Modern scholarship usually assumes that the Hyksos were likely Semites who came from the Levant. Kamose, the last king of the Theban 17th Dynasty, refers to Apophis as a "Chieftain of Retjenu (i.e., Canaan)" in a stela that implies a Semitic Canaanite background for this Hyksos king: this is the strongest evidence for a Canaanite background for the Hyksos. Khyan's name "has generally been interpreted as Amorite "Hayanu" which the Egyptian form represents perfectly, and this is in all likelihood the correct interpretation." Kim Ryholt furthermore observes the name Hayanu is recorded in the Assyrian king-lists for a "remote ancestor" of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1813 BC) of Assyria, which suggests that it had been used for centuries prior to Khyan's own reign.

^Nubia is a region along the Nile river located in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. One of the earliest civilizations of ancient Northeastern Africa, with a history that can be traced from at least 2000 B.C. onward through Nubian monuments and artifacts as well as written records from Egypt and Rome, it was home to one of the African empires.
^The name Nubia is derived from that of the Noba people, nomads who settled the area in the 4th century, with the collapse of the kingdom of Mero. The Noba spoke a Nilo-Saharan language, ancestral to Old Nubian. Old Nubian was mostly used in religious texts dating from the 8th and 15th centuries AD. Before the 4th century, and throughout classical antiquity, Nubia was known as Kush.
^Historically, the people of Nubia spoke at least two varieties of the Nubian language group, a subfamily which includes Nobiin (the descendant of Old Nubian), Kenuzi-Dongola, Midob and several related varieties in the northern part of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan.

^The Kingdom of Kush was an ancient African kingdom situated on the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what is now the Republic of Sudan.
^Established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt, it was centered at Napata in its early phase. After King Kashta ("the Kushite") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt for a century, until they were expelled by Psamtik I in 656 BC.
^During the New Kingdom of Egypt, Nubia (Kush) was an Egyptian colony, from the 16th century BC governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, Kush became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern central Sudan.

^Phoenicia was an ancient Semitic thalassocratic civilization situated on the western, coastal part of the Fertile Crescent and centered on the coastline of modern Syria and Lebanon. All major Phoenician cities were on the coastline of the Mediterranean, some colonies reaching the Western Mediterranean. It was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across theMediterranean from 3200 BC to 300 BC. The Phoenicians used the galley, a man-powered sailing vessel, and are credited with the invention of the bireme. They were famed in Classical Greece and Rome as 'traders in purple', referring to their monopoly on the precious purple dye of the murex snail, used, among other things, for royal clothing, and for the spread of their alphabets, from which almost all modern phonetic alphabets are derived.
^Although Egyptian seafaring expeditions had already been made to Byblos to bring back Lebanon Cedars as early as the 3rd millennium BC, continuous contact only occurred in the Egyptian New Empire period. In the Amarna tablets of the 14th century BC, people from the region called themselves Kenaani or Kinaani.

^Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations globally to arise independently. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh. The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.
^Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedoniansin the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt. In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.

During the 19thand 20th Dynasties of Egypt (c. 1295  1075 BC), the Meshwesh were in almost constant conflict with the Egyptian state. During the late 21st Dynasty, increasing numbers of Meswesh Libyans began to settle in the Western Delta region of Egypt. They would ultimately take control of the country during the late 21st Dynasty first under King Osorkon the Elder. After an interregnum of 38 years, during which the native Egyptian kings Siamun and Psusennes IIassumed the throne, they ruled Egypt throughout the 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th Dynasties under such powerful kings as Smendes, Osorkon the Elder, Shoshenq I, Osorkon I, Osorkon II, Shoshenq III and Osorkon III respectively.

Interestingly, the Elymi people of Iron Age Sicily have been linked to the Tyrsennoi.

^The Sherden were bold sea pirates who appear briefly in fragmentary records from the Bronze Age collapse but about whom very little is known. The costume they wear on reliefs looks similar to, but not the same as, that of the Peleshet, as well as bearing certain similarities to Mycenaean armour. They were sometimes employed as mercenaries, owing to their superior weaponry which could better withstand chariot attacks.They were the earliest of the Sea Peoples to be mentioned, and until recently it was thought by their name and by archaeological finds that they migrated from Greece to Sardinia. Now it seems more likely that they originated on Sardinia and Corsica and migrated eastwards (and perhaps the Tyrsennoi with them). One of them was mentioned in the Armana letters from Egypt (roughly between the 1350s to 1330s BC), as an apparent renegade mercenary, while three more were slain by an Egyptian overseer. 
^In the second year of the reign of Ramses II (1278 BC), the pharaoh repulsed a raid by the Shardana on the Nile Delta, and took Shardana prisoners. He also spoke of the continuing threat which these people posed to the Mediterranean coastline 'in their warships from the midst of the sea', so it is likely they played a notable (if unrecorded) part in the collapse.

^By 1200 B.C, the invaders had destroyed many of the Mycenaean strongholds. And the end of Mycenaean civilization came at about 1100 B.C. Soon the presence of these newcomers had caused enough upheaval in the Eastern Mediterranean Area . This confederation of the people of the Mediterranean countries became known as "The Sea People". Among this group called "The Sea People" were the following: The Peleset and Tjeker of Crete, they would later be known as the "Philistines" after they had settled in Southern Canaan. The Lukka who may have come from the Lycian region of Anatolia, The Ekwesh and Denen seem to be identified with the original Greeks, The (Sherden who may be associated with Sardinia, The Teresh (Tyrrhenians?) - the Greek name for the Etruscans, and The Shekelesh (Sicilians?).
^The Tjekker were part of the combined force of Libyans and Sea Peoples which attacked Egypt in 1208 BC, and they returned in 1179 BC and 1176 BC. Once defeated and captured, they were subsequently settled along the coast of Palestine to help guard Egypt's 'way of the Philistines' between Egypt and Syria. They are thought by some scholars to be linked to the Anatolian Teucri, but another theory links them to Crete (Biblical Caphtor), which was heavily influenced by the Mycenaeans. They could later be found inhabiting some cities in northern Canaan, including Dor.

^The name Pelasgians was used by some ancient Greek writers to refer to populations that were either the ancestors of the Greeks or preceded the Greeks in Greece, "a hold-all term for any ancient, primitive and presumably indigenous people in the Greek world". In general, "Pelasgian" has come to mean more broadly all the indigenous inhabitants of the Aegean Sea region and their cultures before the advent of the Greek language. 
^During the classical period, enclaves under that name survived in several locations of mainland Greece, Crete, and other regions of the Aegean. Populations identified as "Pelasgian" spoke a language or languages that at the time Greeks identified as "barbaric", even though some ancient writers described the Pelasgians as Greeks. A tradition also survived that large parts of Greece had once been Pelasgian before being Hellenized. These parts generally fell within the ethnic domain that, by the 5th century BC, was attributed to those speakers of ancient Greek who were identified as Ionians.
